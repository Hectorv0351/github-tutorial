## Git vs. GitHub
**Git** is a _**distrubted version control**_ and what it git does mainly is when your coding you could save your changes and they'll be saved but it past changes and saves won't be deleted in a way but stored, another thing about it is that if you want to go back to a past change you could.
Some things about Git are...
- Git doesn't Require github to work

**GitHub** is a _**collabortive version control**_ platform which uses git for it's version control and other people could also collab on the same thing as youif you wanted too, so in short github is website that requires git to work and by using git you can keep track of changes or versions but with github it's easier and with collab it helps with that too using version control with all people within the collab
Things from github are...
- Github requires git to work
- Github makes it easier to use version control
- Github makes it so you could collab with others
